    <p>The Company consents only to links to this website in which the link and the

    </p>
    <h3 class="border-bottom-dashed">The Content of Others</h3>

    <p>Much of the content ("content") on our
        Services and the website is produced by users and other third parties
        ("third party content") and may contain content or materials ("materials")
        from publishers or other Users. Whether that content is posted publicly or
        sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or
        organization that submitted it. Although Orbund reserves the right to review
        all content that appears on the website or Services and to remove any
        content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it.
        So we cannotand do nottake responsibility for any content that others
        provide through the website or Services.
    </p>
    <p>Any opinions, advice, statements,
        services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made
        available by Users and third parties, including information providers or any
        other users of the Website or Services, are those of the respective
        author(s) or distributor(s) and not of Orbund.
    </p>
    <p>You are responsible for your
        use of the website and Services and for any Content you provide, including
        compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. As such, you should
        only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others.
    </p>
    <p> Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the website or Services
        or obtained by you through the website or Services is at your own risk. We
        do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness,
        truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications
        posted via the website or Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the
        website or Services. You understand that by using the website or Services,
        you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate
        or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been
        mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. All Content is the sole
        responsibility of the person who originated such Content.
    </p>
    <p> We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the website or Services and, we cannot
        take responsibility for such Content. We will respond to notices of alleged
        copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly
        provided to us. Through these Terms, we make clear that we do not want the
        website or Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all
        content, we cannot guarantee that content on the website or Services will
        always conform to our Terms. You may be able to post User Content. You must
        not post any User Content that is threatening, abusive, unlawful,
        misleading, fraudulent, discriminatory, libelous, defamatory, obscene or
        otherwise objectionable, or that contains ethnic, sexual, racial or other
        discriminating slurs. You must also not post any User Content that contains
        proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information,
        solicitations, advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment
        opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as
        otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes
        spamming or flooding.
    </p>
    <p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content
        containing state, government or federal identification information or
        numbers (whether your own or of another person), such as national
        identification number, social security number, passport number, insurance
        number, driver's license number, immigration number, or any other similar
        number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information could
        possibly cause identity theft. The Company may remove any such
        identification information, but we are under no obligation to do so and have
        no responsibility and disclaim all liability or damages for any user posting
        of such identification information.
    </p>
    <p> The Company reserves the right to
        disclose all User Content and other relevant or related information, and the
        circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in
        connection with operating the Site and Services; to protect itself, its
        affiliates, its partners and its users or visitors; and to comply with legal
        obligations or governmental requests. What this means is that we may honor
        law enforcement or court-mandated requests such as subpoenas or search
        warrants to reveal a user's electronic address and identity, or other
        properly requested information.
    </p>
    <p>Although we have no obligation to do so, we
        may monitor User Content, and reserve the right to delete any User Content
        or portion thereof that, in the Company's sole discretion, violates the
        above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific
        area of the Site or Services on which it is posted, or that is an
        advertisement, or other commercial message, or that the Company determines
        in its sole discretion to be inappropriate. If you believe that any User
        Content violates this Agreement or our policies, we encourage you to report
        the content or conduct to us so that we may have the opportunity to consider
        whether to remove the content or not. Just so there is no ambiguity in these
        terms and conditions, the Company does not have any obligation to remove any
        User Content, and whether User Content is deemed to be inappropriate or
        violates any Company policy will always remain within the sole discretion of
        the Company.
    </p>
    <p> Please take note of the following: Section 230 of the U.S.
        Communications Decency Act provides that:
    </p>
    <p> (1) Treatment of publisher or
        speaker No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be
        treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
        information content provider.
    </p>
    <p>(2) Civil liability No provider or user of an
        interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-
    </p>
    <p class="p-child">(A) any
        action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability
        of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd,
        lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise
        objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected;
        or
    </p>
    <p class="p-child">(B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content
        providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material
        described in paragraph (1).
